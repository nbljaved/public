Basically relying on https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css

#+caption: Download the css

curl -o ./html/static/css/simple.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevquirk/simple.css/refs/heads/main/simple.css

* Web analytics

I am relying on cloudflare.
Visit https://dash.cloudflare.com -> Analytics -> Web analytics

* TODO

Maybe use https://github.com/gnat/surreal ?
